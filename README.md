<h1 align="center">rax</h1>

<h5 align="center">
rax is a CPU emulator that does not trust itself. It implements four instruction sets in software —<br/>
x86-64, AArch64, Hexagon, and RISC-V — and checks every one of them, instruction by instruction,<br/>
against a reference that cannot be argued with: real silicon (KVM) for x86-64, and QEMU for the rest.<br/>
<br/>
The x86-64 core is a complete machine. It boots a real Linux kernel two ways — through hardware<br/>
virtualization (KVM on Linux, Hypervisor.framework on macOS) at near-native speed, or through a<br/>
from-scratch interpreter you can trace, single-step, snapshot, and profile — and it covers the ISA out<br/>
to AVX-512, AVX10.2, and Intel APX. Behind it sits SMIR, a shared multi-architecture IR with a working<br/>
hot-block JIT that lifts hot x86-64 loops to native code at ~80× the interpreter. Three more software<br/>
CPUs run alongside: a fully oracle-verified Hexagon (every opcode, scalar + HVX), an AArch64 with<br/>
complete SVE, and a correctly-rounded RV64GC — RISC-V and Hexagon are bootable emulator backends in
their own right.

## The thirty-second version

Build it, then run a Linux kernel — at silicon speed, or one instruction at a time:

```bash
cargo build --release

# 1. Boot a real Linux kernel on hardware virtualization (Linux + KVM).
./target/release/rax --kernel bzImage --initrd initrd.img

# 2. Boot the same kernel on the software CPU. Slower, but every instruction is yours.
./target/release/rax --backend emulator --kernel bzImage --initrd initrd.img

# 3. ...and trace every instruction the kernel executes, SDE-compatible.
./target/release/rax --backend emulator --kernel bzImage --trace boot.trace

# 4. ...turn on the native JIT for hot loops (~80× on register-heavy code).
cargo run --release --features smir-jit -- --backend emulator --kernel bzImage
```

RISC-V and Hexagon are bootable emulator backends too (bare-metal programs, UART + halt):

```bash
./target/release/rax --arch riscv64 --backend emulator --kernel program.elf
```

And all four cores are checked against a reference oracle — each harness runs an instruction on both rax
and the reference from an identical state, then diffs the result:

```bash
cargo test --release --test differential       # x86-64  vs. KVM (the silicon)
cargo test --release --test arm_diff           # AArch64 vs. qemu-aarch64
cargo test --release --test hexagon_hvx_diff   # Hexagon vs. qemu-hexagon
cargo test --release --test riscv_diff         # RV64GC  vs. qemu-riscv64
```

> **Good to know** Every oracle harness self-skips cleanly if the cross-compiler / QEMU / `/dev/kvm`
> isn't present, so the suite is green on any host. They only fail when rax and the reference genuinely
> disagree.

## Why it exists

If you have ever wondered what actually happens between launching a kernel and seeing a shell, most tools
give you one of two unsatisfying answers. A real hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) runs the kernel so fast you cannot
watch it; the CPU is a black box. A pure emulator (Bochs, Unicorn) lets you watch, but its instruction
coverage trails the hardware by years, and you have no easy way to know whether what it *did* matches
what a real chip would have done.

rax is built around the second problem. A software CPU is only as good as your confidence that it is
*right*, and the only honest way to earn that confidence is to compare it, instruction by instruction,
against something authoritative. So that comparison is the project's spine, not an afterthought:

- **x86-64** is checked against **KVM** — the actual silicon in your machine. The same machine code runs
  on the interpreter and on hardware from an identical architectural state, and the final state is
  diffed. When you want to know what an instruction *should* do, you ask the chip.
- **AArch64, Hexagon, and RISC-V** are each checked against **QEMU** in user mode, the same way: a tiny
  reference harness loads a state, runs one instruction, and reports back; rax runs it from the identical
  state; any divergence is a bug, reported precisely.

That methodology is what lets rax be both *legible* — you can open `insn/arith/add.rs` and read exactly
what `ADD` does to the flags — and *trusted*: it tracks four instruction sets out to their modern vector
extensions, and well over a hundred thousand cases stand between a change and a regression. It is also
what lets the JIT exist at all: a native code generator is only safe if you can prove its output matches
the interpreter, and the same oracle does that proof.

---

## What a run looks like

A throughput benchmark of the x86-64 interpreter's hot path (`examples/bench_loop.rs`, a tight
register-only guest loop) reports sustained MIPS — the apples-to-apples metric for interpreter work:

```text
$ RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release --example bench_loop
[bench] iterations    : 268435456 (0x10000000)
[bench] expected insns: 1342177283
[bench] executed insns: 1342177283
[bench] elapsed       : 9.26 s
[bench] throughput    : ~145 MIPS
[bench] final eax=0x20000000 ecx=0x0
```

Turn on `--features smir-jit` and that same loop is detected as hot, lifted to SMIR, lowered to native
x86-64, and run directly — **~11,000 MIPS, roughly 80×**, bit-identical to the interpreter (the JIT-tier
vcpu test asserts register-for-register equality).

Boot a kernel under the emulator with `--trace`, and every retired instruction lands in an
SDE-compatible trace file — instruction, register changes, and (when they happen) memory reads/writes
and XMM updates — that you can diff against Intel's own Software Development Emulator:

```text
$ ./target/release/rax --backend emulator --kernel bzImage --trace boot.trace
...
$ head -4 boot.trace
INS 0x00000000010000f0   xor eax, eax                                       | eax=0x00000000
INS 0x00000000010000f2   mov ecx, 0x80000000                                | ecx=0x80000000
INS 0x00000000010000f7   mov cr0, eax                                       | cr0=0x80000011
Write *(UINT64*)0x9000 = 0x000000000000a003
```

> **Good to know** The trace, GDB stub, snapshot facility, and per-mnemonic profiler are all wired into
> the *interpreter's* step loop, so they observe the genuine instruction stream — not a re-derived
> approximation. The KVM backend traps only on I/O, so it is fast but opaque by design.

## Four CPUs

x86-64 is the complete VM target — it boots Linux, with the full device platform, boot protocol, tracing,
GDB, snapshots, and the JIT. Hexagon and RISC-V are bootable emulator backends for bare-metal programs.
AArch64 is the deepest-tested core but the one *not* yet wired as a runnable backend — it lives entirely
behind its oracle. All four also have SMIR lifters.

| Core | Size | Runnable? | Coverage | Oracle |
|------|-----:|-----------|----------|--------|
| **x86-64** | ~50k LOC | **boots Linux** (KVM/HVF/emulator) + JIT | Legacy → SSE/AVX/AVX2 → AVX-512 → AVX10.1/10.2 → APX; x87; AES/SHA/GFNI; XSAVE | KVM (real hardware) |
| **Hexagon** | ~37k LOC | bare-metal (`--arch hexagon`) | V73 scalar + VLIW packets + HVX — **every opcode verified** | qemu-hexagon |
| **RISC-V** | ~7k LOC | bare-metal (`--arch riscv64`) | full RVA23 *scalar* set (RV64GC + Zfh/Zicond/Zfa/Zbk\*/Zcb + scalar crypto + vector-config) | qemu-riscv64 |
| **AArch64 / ARM** | ~45k LOC | validated only (no backend yet) | A64 base, **complete SVE** + SVE2, NEON/VFP, FP16; AArch32/Thumb; Cortex-M (M0–M85) | qemu-aarch64 + ASL |

### x86-64 — the complete machine

The primary target and the one that boots Linux. A full decoder handles the entire encoding zoo (REX and
REX2, every legacy prefix including the `0x67` address-size override, ModR/M + SIB, VEX2/VEX3, EVEX
including APX Map 4, RIP-relative), feeding 88 instruction-implementation files.

| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| **Integer / logic / bit** | full ALU, ADCX/ADOX, BT/BTS/BTR/BTC, BSF/BSR, POPCNT/LZCNT/TZCNT; `#DE` on ÷0/overflow |
| **Shifts / strings / BCD** | SHL…RCR, SHLD/SHRD; REP MOVS/STOS/SCAS/CMPS (bulk fast path); DAA…AAD |
| **x87 FPU** | escape codes D8–DF via f64 |
| **SSE → SSE4 / AVX / AVX2** | moves, arithmetic, all compare predicates, shuffle/permute/convert (XMM/YMM) |
| **FMA / BMI1 / BMI2** | VFMADD/SUB/NMADD/NSUB {132,213,231}; ANDN, BZHI, PEXT, PDEP, MULX, … |
| **AVX-512** | F / VL / BW / DQ / CD; masked ops, opmask k0–k7 |
| **AVX10.1 / 10.2** | VNNI, IFMA, VPOPCNTDQ, VBMI, BF16; VMPSADBW, VMINMAX, saturating converts |
| **APX** | REX2, EGPRs R16–R31, NDD (3-operand), NF (no-flags), EVEX Map 4 |
| **Crypto / state / system** | AES, SHA1/256, GFNI (FIPS/SDM known-answer tested); XSAVE/XRSTOR/XCR0; CPUID, MSRs, CR/DR, descriptor-table loads — CPL-checked, faults injected (`#UD`/`#GP`) |

### Hexagon — complete, every opcode

A Qualcomm Hexagon (V73) implementation where **all 2,178 instruction opcodes are decoded, executed, and
differentially verified against qemu-hexagon at zero divergence** — scalar core, the full HVX vector set,
even the awkward corners (CABAC bin decode, scatter/gather, FP reciprocal/sqrt seed tables recovered from
the oracle). It takes the hard parts seriously:

- **VLIW packets** — true parallel-packet semantics: all instructions read the old register file and
  commit atomically at packet end; `.new` value forwarding for scalars *and* HVX vectors; duplex
  encodings; hardware loops (SA0/LC0, SA1/LC1) with circular and bit-reversed addressing; dual stores.
- **HVX** — 1024-bit vectors V0–V31 and predicates Q0–Q3: ALU, compare, min/max, the full multiply
  family, permute, shift, round/saturate, LUT, histogram, vector-predicate ops, `vmem` loads/stores
  (`.cur`/`.tmp`, scalar-predicated), and V65 scatter/gather.

### RISC-V — small, correct, and bootable

A complete **RV64GC** core (~7k lines) wired into the VMM as a real `--arch riscv64 --backend emulator`
target: it loads an ELF, drives a 16550 UART over MMIO, and halts on `ecall`. Coverage is the **entire
RVA23 scalar set** — RV64I/M/A/F/D, **Zfh** half-precision, C (compressed), Zicsr/Zifencei,
Zba/Zbb/Zbc/Zbs, Zicond, Zfa, Zbkb/Zbkx/Zcb, the full scalar **crypto** suite (Zknh SHA-256/512, Zksh
SM3, Zksed SM4, Zkne/Zknd AES), and the vector *configuration* instructions (vsetvl\*, VLEN=128). The
floating-point core computes the round-to-nearest result, recovers the *exact* residual (2Sum / FMA /
Newton), and uses it to deliver correctly-rounded answers in all five rounding modes with all five IEEE
flags. It's checked against qemu-riscv64 by fuzzers that drive ~300k comparisons across the whole
non-control-flow opcode space.

### AArch64 / ARM — the deepest core

The largest and most thoroughly tested ISA, even though it isn't a runnable backend yet:

- **SVE** — **complete**: no valid SVE encoding is unhandled. The full data-processing set (predicate
  generation/logical, predicated integer & FP ALU, reductions, permutes, CPY/SEL/CMP, shifts), the
  entire memory subsystem (contiguous, gather/scatter, LD2-4/ST2-4, first-fault + FFR), all at VL=128.
- **SVE2** — broad and growing: long/wide/narrow integer ops, complex arithmetic, bit-permute,
  saturating multiplies, pairwise, FP conversions, indexed multiplies.
- **NEON / VFP** — full Advanced SIMD and scalar FP including FP16; full crypto (AES, SHA1/256, SM3, SM4).
- **AArch32 / Thumb-2 / Cortex-M (M0–M85)** — A32 + Thumb decoders, NVIC/SysTick/SCB/MPU, ARMv6-M → v8.1-M.

## Correctness: every architecture has an oracle

This is the part that matters. rax's claim is not "it implements a lot of instructions" — it is "the
instructions are *checked against an authority*." Each harness builds an initial architectural state,
runs one instruction (or a short sequence) on both rax and the reference from that identical state, then
diffs the full register file (and, for x86, a scratch memory page). Inputs are enumerated over encoding
fields and driven with many pseudo-random states, so a single `#[test]` function covers a large family.

| Harness | rax core | Oracle | `#[test]` fns | Compares |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------:|----------|
| `tests/differential.rs` | x86-64 | **KVM** (hardware) | 463 | GPRs, RIP, RFLAGS, XMM, memory |
| `tests/arm_diff.rs` | AArch64 + SVE/SVE2 | `qemu-aarch64` | 134 | X0–X30, SP, NZCV, V0–V31, P0–P15 |
| `tests/hexagon_*_diff.rs` | Hexagon (scalar / cf / float / mem / HVX / HVX-mem) | `qemu-hexagon` | 134 | GPRs, P3:0, USR, loop regs, V0–V31, Q0–Q3 |
| `tests/riscv_diff.rs` | RV64GC | `qemu-riscv64` | 29 | x1–x31, f0–f31, fcsr, scratch |
| `tests/diff_fuzz.rs` | SMIR (lift → interp / native) | KVM | 35 | guest state after lift+run |
| `tests/smir_jit_vcpu.rs` | SMIR JIT in the real vcpu | interpreter | 7 | register-for-register + throughput |

> **Good to know** Those `#[test]` counts understate the work by orders of magnitude — each function
> enumerates many encodings and many random input states internally (the ARM and RISC-V fuzzers drive
> hundreds of thousands of comparisons per run). The reference harnesses are tiny C/asm programs
> (`tools/{arm,riscv,hexagon}-diff/`) that QEMU runs as ground truth; for x86 the ground truth is KVM.

### Tests by the numbers

On top of the oracles, there are exhaustive unit suites:

| Suite | Count | How |
|-------|------:|-----|
| **ARM (ASL-generated)** | 92,131 | generated from ARM's official machine-readable **ASL** spec via `tools/asl-parser/` |
| **x86-64 instruction suite** | 28,554 | `tests/x86_64/` (850 files), behind `--features x86_64-suite` |
| **Everything else** | ~1,000 | oracle harnesses, Hexagon bare-metal, RISC-V boot, crypto known-answer (FIPS/SDM), SMIR |
| **Total** | **121,734** | `#[test]` functions across `tests/` |

The ARM tests are not written by hand: the `asl-parser` downloads and parses ARM's ASL release and emits
exhaustive instruction tests from it, which is how 92,000+ ARM cases exist at all.

## SMIR and the hot-block JIT

**SMIR** (Sigma Machine IR, `src/smir/`, ~36k LOC; spec in
[`docs/specifications/smir/`](docs/specifications/smir/)) is the layer that makes "four CPUs" one
project. Each guest architecture has a *lifter* that translates its instructions into a common set of
100+ typed operations; the IR is interpreted directly, optimized, and — for x86-64 — lowered to native
host machine code.

```text
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │   x86-64 · AArch64 · Hexagon · RISC-V · AVX10   │   per-arch lifters
  └────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                           ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                   SMIR Module                   │   SmirFunction → SmirBlock → SmirOp

         ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
         ▼                 ▼                 ▼
     Interpreter       optimizer        x86-64 JIT → native
     (lazy flags)      (O0/O1/O2)       (emit · regalloc · W^X)
```

The native JIT is real and integrated. Behind the `smir-jit` feature, the `X86_64Vcpu` run loop
auto-detects hot loops (a back-edge counter promotes a region at a threshold of 64), lifts the region to
SMIR, lowers it to native x86-64, caches the compiled block, and runs it through a W^X `mmap` trampoline.
On the bench loop the lowered body is one native instruction per guest instruction — **~80× the
interpreter (~11,000 MIPS)**, bit-identical to interpreting it.

What makes that safe to ship is a **fail-safe whitelist**: only register-only operations that have been
proven equal to KVM (ALU, shifts, multiply, mov/extend, setcc/cmov, branches) are JIT-eligible. Anything
touching memory, division (the RDX:RAX double-width model isn't lowered yet), FP/SIMD, or an unknown op
makes the region **bail back to the interpreter** — it never executes natively unless it is known
correct. Self-modifying code invalidates compiled blocks via the MMU's dirty-page journal, and a
frontier-less spin loop is refused so native code can't trap the vcpu.

| Piece | Where | State |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Lifters** | `lift/` | x86-64 (most mature), AArch64, Hexagon, RISC-V, AVX10 |
| **Interpreter** | `interp.rs` | direct execution; lazy flags, block caching |
| **Optimizer** | `opt.rs` | dead-flag elimination, constant propagation, strength reduction |
| **JIT lowering** | `lower/x86_64.rs`, `lower/regalloc.rs`, `lower/runtime.rs` | x86-64 emitter, 1:1 register map, W^X exec runtime + trampoline |
| **JIT integration** | `backend/.../x86_64/cpu.rs` (`smir-jit`) | hot-loop detection, region cache, safety gate, SMC invalidation |

> **Good to know** The JIT accelerates without changing behaviour: a kernel boots identically with it on
> or off, because every region it can't prove correct degrades gracefully to the interpreter. What
> remains for a *general* JIT is memory-operand blocks (guest RAM mapped at host addresses), the
> double-width DIV model, and native block-to-block chaining.

## How the x86-64 machine works

### The Linux boot protocol

Both x86-64 backends bring a kernel to its 64-bit entry point the same way:

1. Load the kernel (ELF or bzImage) at physical `0x1000000` (16 MiB) and the initrd at `0x4000000`.
2. Build initial page tables: identity-map the first 8 GiB with 1 GiB huge pages, kernel space at
   `0xFFFFFFFF80000000`, direct physical map at `0xFFFF888000000000`.
3. Install a minimal GDT with 64-bit code/data segments.
4. Enter long mode (`CR0.PG=1`, `CR4.PAE=1`, `EFER.LME=1`) and jump to the kernel's entry.

### The interpreter loop

Fetch / decode / execute, with two twists that make it both fast and honest:

```text
loop {
    entry = decode_cache[rip & 0xFFF];          // 4096-entry, RIP-indexed
    insn  = if entry.matches(rip, mode) {
        entry.bytes                              // HIT: skip the memory fetch entirely
    } else {
        decode(fetch(rip))                       // MISS: prefixes, ModR/M, SIB, VEX/EVEX, immediates
    };
    execute(insn);                               // update regs / memory / lazy flags
    if (++insn_count & 1023) == 0 { poll_lapic_and_yield(); }
}
```

| Mechanism | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Decode cache** | 4096 entries indexed by RIP, keyed on a mode tag (`CR3 \| CS.L \| CS.D`). A hit reuses the cached bytes and **skips the guest-memory fetch entirely**. Kept coherent by SMC detection on guest writes. |
| **Lazy flags** | Arithmetic records its operands and defers RFLAGS materialization until a consumer (a `Jcc`, a `PUSHF`) reads them. Most computed flags are never needed. |
| **Fast paths** | A direct host-pointer path for physical RAM, a fast path for common ModR/M memory operands, and page-at-a-time `REP MOVS`/`STOS`. |
| **Hot-block JIT** | With `--features smir-jit`, hot loops promote to native code (see above). |
| **TLB** | 256-entry direct-mapped cache over the 4-level page walk (4 KiB / 2 MiB / 1 GiB pages). |

The interpreter sustains around **145 MIPS** on the register loop; the JIT tier lifts that to ~11,000 on
hot regions.

## Devices

The running machine wires up a classic PC platform: a 16550 serial console, 8254 PIT, 8259 PIC, LAPIC +
IOAPIC, RTC/CMOS, a PCI host bridge, QEMU `fw_cfg`, and the Bochs-style debug port.

Alongside those, `src/devices/` carries a growing library of full **register-level controller models** —
1,000–1,500 lines each — built and tested ahead of being attached to the default machine:

| Class | Models |
|-------|--------|
| **Storage** | AHCI, NVMe, IDE, virtio-blk, floppy (FDC) |
| **Network** | Intel e1000 |
| **Display / audio / USB** | VGA, AC97, UHCI |
| **Platform** | HPET, i8042 (PS/2), DMA, IOAPIC, system-control ports |

> **Good to know** The classic boot set is live in the VM today; the larger controllers (AHCI/NVMe/e1000/
> VGA/…) are implemented as standalone device models and not yet bound to the guest's I/O bus, so a guest
> won't see an NVMe disk until that wiring lands. The code is real; the cabling is in progress.

---

## Observability & tooling

Because the interpreter owns the step loop, the introspection tools see the real instruction stream:

| Tool | Flag / feature | What you get |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Instruction trace** | `--trace <file>` (`--features trace`) | SDE-compatible per-instruction trace, diffable against Intel SDE |
| **GDB stub** | `--gdb <port> --wait-gdb` (`--features debug`) | Remote Serial Protocol server: registers, memory, stepping |
| **Snapshots** | `--snapshot-interval N` / `--snapshot-at a,b,c` / `--resume <file>` | full VM state (registers + zstd-compressed memory, bincode-serialized); save at instruction counts, resume later |
| **Profiler** | `--profile` (`--features profiling`) | per-mnemonic execution counts and a hot-instruction report, optional JSON export |

---

## Building

```bash
# Default (Linux): KVM backend enabled.
cargo build --release

# Cross-platform: software emulator only, no KVM.
cargo build --release --no-default-features

# With the native hot-block JIT (x86-64 host).
cargo build --release --features smir-jit

# Fastest local interpreter (uses your host's full ISA).
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

> **Good to know** `.cargo/config.toml` ships `target-cpu=x86-64-v3` as a portable default — it still
> lets LLVM emit AVX2/BMI2/FMA and autovectorize the scalar SIMD/flag loops while staying runnable on any
> 2013-or-later x86-64 host. The release profile is fat-LTO, one codegen unit, `panic=abort`, stripped.

| Feature | Default | Enables |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `kvm` | ✓ (Linux) | KVM backend (`kvm-bindings` / `kvm-ioctls`) |
| `smir-jit` | | SMIR native hot-block JIT tier (x86-64 host; brings in the W^X exec runtime) |
| `trace` | | SDE-compatible instruction tracing |
| `debug` | | GDB Remote Serial Protocol server |
| `profiling` | | per-mnemonic profiler + JSON export |
| `x86_64-suite` | | the 28,554-case x86-64 instruction test suite |

---

## The microkernel test harness

`microkernel/` is a freestanding bare-metal x86-64 kernel used to exercise the interpreter end to end
without a full Linux image — an N-body physics simulation, a bump allocator, and broad instruction
coverage — the same binary runnable on rax and on Intel SDE for cross-checking.

```bash
cd microkernel
make baremetal     # build the bare-metal ELF
make test-rax      # boot it in the rax software emulator
make test-sde      # run it under Intel SDE for a reference trace
```

## Status

| Path | State |
|------|-------|
| **x86-64 — KVM/HVF** | Boots Linux to an interactive shell |
| **x86-64 — software** | Full modern ISA; 463 differential cases vs. KVM; native JIT (`smir-jit`) at ~80× on hot loops |
| **Hexagon** | **Every opcode** (scalar + HVX) verified vs. qemu-hexagon; bootable bare-metal backend |
| **RISC-V** | Full RVA23 scalar set + crypto; bootable `--arch riscv64` backend; verified vs. qemu-riscv64 |
| **AArch64 / ARM** | Complete SVE + broad SVE2 + NEON + Cortex-M; ~92k ASL tests; not yet a runnable backend |
| **SMIR JIT** | Integrated + auto-triggered + fail-safe; register-only hot loops native, bit-exact vs. KVM |

### What's missing

A production hypervisor this is not — by design. Only x86-64 boots a general-purpose OS; the ARM core is
validated but not yet wired as a backend, and the larger device controllers aren't attached to the
default machine. There is no SMP (one vCPU executes). The JIT covers register-only hot loops; memory
blocks, double-width DIV, and block chaining are future work. RISC-V lacks the RVV vector data path and a
privileged/Sv39 MMU. And the **software** full Linux boot is still being chased: with mitigation
work-arounds on the cmdline it reaches clocksource calibration before spinning on a bug in rax's
emulation of the kernel's alternatives/relocation patching — the KVM path boots cleanly throughout.

## A note on the name

`rax` is the x86-64 accumulator register — the first register the manuals introduce. The project started
x86-64-centric and the name stuck even as it grew three more instruction sets; it is also just the crate
name, so `cargo run` and you are off.
