//! Intel 8253/8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation.
//!
//! The PIT provides three independent 16-bit counters (channels 0-2):
//! - Channel 0: System timer, generates IRQ 0
//! - Channel 1: Originally DRAM refresh (not used in modern systems)
//! - Channel 2: PC speaker (gated by port 0x61 bit 0, OUT readable at bit 5)
//!
//! I/O ports:
//! - 0x40: Channel 0 data
//! - 0x41: Channel 1 data
//! - 0x42: Channel 2 data
//! - 0x43: Mode/Command register
//!
//! Timing is based on wall-clock time for real-time behavior: each channel's
//! current count and OUT level are derived from the number of PIT oscillator
//! ticks elapsed since the counter was (re)loaded.
//!
//! ## Operating modes implemented
//! - Mode 0 (interrupt on terminal count): OUT low after reload, goes high when
//!   the count reaches 0 and stays high.
//! - Mode 1 (hardware retriggerable one-shot): gate-triggered; OUT modelled but
//!   triggering is partial (the PIT only sees the gate level, not edges).
//! - Mode 2 (rate generator): OUT high, pulses low for one tick at terminal
//!   count, reloads and repeats.
//! - Mode 3 (square wave): OUT toggles, ~50% duty cycle, reloads each half period.
//! - Mode 4 (software-triggered strobe): OUT high, strobes low for one tick when
//!   the count reaches 0, then stays high until reprogrammed.
//! - Mode 5 (hardware-triggered strobe): gate-triggered strobe; partial, see Mode 1.
